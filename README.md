# ListApp
### Basic webview app linking directly to my google shopping list

At the time I made this, I wanted to make more of a custom UI to interact with my google shopping list.
It had to be that one specifically as I used a google home mini to add to a list, and my most convenient access was through a 
mobile web browser

I'm not sure if my idea was even possible, or whether it was just beyond what I knew, but this worked pretty well and I still use it every shopping trip
